XPRESS Model Library of Mathematical Programming Models
The XPRESS Library is a collection of math programming models (LP and MIP) from XPRESS Model Library (Examples) (https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization). The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original XPRESS source.

The raw GAMS models were converted into GAMS scalar format using the CONVERT facility. For models with multiple solves, only the first solve instance is translated.
