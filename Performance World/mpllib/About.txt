The MPL Library is a collection of math programming models from MPL Model Library (Examples) (http://www.maximal-usa.com/mpllib/ **out of date/ unreachable). The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original MPL source.

The raw GAMS models were converted into GAMS scalar format using the CONVERT facility. For models with multiple solves, only the first solve instance is translated.
