The AMPL Book Library is a collection of math programming models from The AMPL Book. AMPL: A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming (https://ampl.com/resources/the-ampl-book/) by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan. The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original AMPL source.

The raw GAMS models were converted into GAMS scalar format using the CONVERT facility. For models with multiple solves, only the first solve instance is translated.
