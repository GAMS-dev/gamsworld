This collection of models gams from the _GAMS World Initiative_ and in particular the _Performance World Libraries_. 
The purpose of these collections is to provide users with an established and varied set of both theoretical and practical test models.
Models from various sources (AMPL, MOSEL, MPL, ...) have been made available in as GAMS models and generated as scalar models. This 
project contains the following model collections:

# AMPLBookLib

The AMPL Book Library is a collection of math programming models from The AMPL Book. AMPL: [A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming](https://dev.ampl.com/ampl/book.html) 
by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan. The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original 
[AMPL source](https://ampl.com/learn/ampl-book/example-files/).

# Fixed Cost Network Flow Library FCNetLib

FCNetLib is a collection of instances for the fixed cost network flow problem. The purpose of the collection is to provide a unified presentation of the data instances together with some GAMS models that implement a straight forward IP formulation and a more sophisticated version that utilizes the GAMS/BCH facility. A class of known cuts (dicuts) is implemented as well as the local branching heuristic within the BCH framework.

# GLOBALLib Model Library

GLOBALLib is a collection of Nonlinear Programming models. The purpose of the collection is to provide algorithm developer of global optimization codes with a large and varied set of both theoretical and practical test models.
[GLOBALLib has been integrated into MINLPLib](http://www.minlplib.org/). This is an old version that is no-longer maintained.

# LINLib Model Library

This is a large collection of linear and quadratic models. Some of the the instances also contain discrete variables.

# MINLPLib Model Library

MINLPLib is a collection of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming models. 
The purpose of the collection is to provide algorithm developers with a large and varied set of both theoretical and practical test models.
This is an old version of MINLPLib that is no-longer maintained. The current MINLPLib is available at http://www.minlplib.org/

# MIPLIB 2010

The MIPLIB is a famous library of mixed integer programming problem instances. 

This copy of the MIPLIB 2010 features the instances in a format conventient for GAMS users. 

The original MIPLIB 2010 with more statistical information, classifications, references and so on on the individual instances can be found at https://miplib2010.zib.de/.

# MPEC Library

MPECLib is a collection of Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints. The purpose of the collection is to provide algorithm developers with a large and varied set of both theoretical and practical test models.

# MPL Model Library of Mathematical Programming Models

The MPL Library is a collection of math programming models from MPL Model Library. The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original MPL source.(http://www.maximalsoftware.com/modellib/)

# MacMOOP - A Collection of Multiobjective Optimization Testproblems

MacMOOP is a collection of multiobjective optimizatin testproblems from Sven Leyffer. The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original AMPL source.(https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/MacMOOP)

# Princeton Library of Nonlinear Programming Models

PrincetonLib is a collection of nonlinear programming (NLP) models. The purpose of the collection is to provide algorithm developers of nonlinear optimization codes with a large and varied set of both theoretical and practical test models. 
It also aids in the software quality assurance process by providing a set of tools to facilitate benchmarking and performance analysis.

# XPRESS Model Library of Mathematical Programming Models

The XPRESS Library is a collection of math programming models (LP and MIP) from XPRESS Model Library (Examples at ttps://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization).

#  ZabinskyEtAlLib Selected Continuous Global Optimization Test Problems

The models shown are a collection of continuous global optimization test problems originally used in

A Numerical Evaluation of Several Stochastic Algorithms on Selected Continuous Global Optimization Test Problems, Ali, Khompatraporn and Zabinsky, Journal of Global Optimization (2005) 31:635-672. (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-004-9972-2)
