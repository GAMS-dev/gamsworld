# Electrons on a Sphere

A metallic sphere conducts electricity, which means surplus electrons are free to move around. According to Coulomb's law, they repel each other with a force that is proportional to the square of the inverse of the distance separating them. The problem is to determine an equilibrium distribution for a collection of n surplus electrons.
