# MacMOOP - A Collection of Multiobjective Optimization Testproblems

MacMOOP is a collection of multiobjective optimizatin testproblems from Sven Leyffer. The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original AMPL source.(https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/MacMOOP)

The indexed GAMS models were converted into GAMS scalar format using the CONVERT facility. For models with multiple solves, only the first solve instance is translated.

Total number of models:   14
