# XPRESS Model Library of Mathematical Programming Models

The XPRESS Library is a collection of math programming models (LP and MIP) from XPRESS Model Library (Examples at ttps://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization).
The GAMS models were translated by Andre Savistky as is from the original XPRESS source.

The indexed GAMS models were converted into GAMS scalar format using the CONVERT facility. For models with multiple solves, only the first solve instance is translated.
